# Ask Gemini - A Flutter AI Chat Application

Ask Gemini is an AI-powered chatbot application built with Flutter. It integrates speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and image-based interaction features to allow users to communicate with a conversational AI called Gemini. Users can either type messages, speak directly, or send images to the chatbot to receive meaningful responses.

## Features

- **Text-based Chat:** Users can type questions or chat with the AI bot Gemini.
- **Voice Chat:** Integrates speech-to-text to allow users to speak to the bot, with real-time transcription and processing.
- **Image-based Queries:** Users can upload images from their gallery, and the app uses the Gemini AI to describe or respond to them.
- **Text-to-Speech:** The app reads Gemini's responses aloud, providing a hands-free experience.
- **Animated Splash Screen:** A beautiful, animated splash screen using Lottie animation provides a smooth transition while the app loads.
- **Real-time Chat Interface:** Displays an intuitive chat interface using the `dash_chat_2` package, including user avatars and chat bubbles.
- **Permissions:** Handles microphone and storage permissions to allow voice input and image selection.

## Splash Screen Animation

The app features a **Lottie animated splash screen** that enhances the user experience with a visually appealing loading animation. The splash screen is displayed when the app starts, offering a seamless and polished introduction before the chat screen loads.

- **Lottie**: The splash screen is implemented using the [Lottie package](https://pub.dev/packages/lottie), which allows for smooth, vector-based animations.
